This is not for the feint of heart. A single Elcan puts out 48 volts which is considered safe, but in the right circumsances will still fsck you up in a bad way. Hooking up 2 in series WILL BE POTENTIALLY LETHAL so please, pretty please, charry on top... BE CAREFULL

The goal of this project is to document the way I programmed two Elcan Flatpack S 48V/1800W units to deliver 115,2V CCCV charging current to a Zero DSR electric motorcycle. Also, for documenting my efforts for later use. This entire project was done in 2016 so I'll have to reconstruct a lot.

This repo consists of two parts: The first part all the code stolen from Endless Sphere, the second part what I cooked up from it to make the Elcan's play nice.
